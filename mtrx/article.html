<h1>Matrices: how they work?</h1>

<h3>Preface</h3>
			
Transfomration matrices are first class citizens in game development but many developers use them as a black box over decades. 
Most materials over the internet explain them in a difficult way which doesn't really demonstrate why bunch of number multiplications performs all the magic. 
<br><br>
In this article I want to introduce an easy way to think about matrices that reveal geometric sense in a visual, intuitive & interactive way.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

Reader should be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)">Vector Arithmetic</a>.
It would also be good to have  a basic understanding of a matrices as a black box objects that store somehow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map">linear transformations</a> and can combine them by matrix multiplication operation.
